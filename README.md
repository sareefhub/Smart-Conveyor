## Background and Importance

Currently, automation technology and intelligent systems play an important role in the manufacturing industry 🤖 to **reduce dependence on human labor** and increase **efficiency** in operations 🚀. Therefore, studying and simulating the design model of a **conveyor system** is essential to meet the industry's demand for precise and continuous production processes ⚙️.

This project focuses on designing and developing a conveyor system integrated with **automated robotic arms** 🤖, utilizing **Internet of Things (IoT)** technology 🌐 to control operations and collect data wirelessly 📡. This approach allows for efficient tracking and analysis of the production process, reducing human errors ❌ and enhancing system adaptability for various applications 🔧. Additionally, using machinery and intelligent systems in the process helps **reduce labor costs** and improve **safety** in production 🛡️.

## Objectives

1. **Study and design** a model for the operation of a conveyor system integrated with automated robotic arms to enhance efficiency in conveying and sorting objects.
  
2. **Develop and simulate** the operation of the conveyor system and robotic arm using **Internet of Things (IoT)** technology to control and command the system wirelessly.

3. **Propose methods** for future development and improvement of automation systems to be applied in industries requiring more efficient production processes.
